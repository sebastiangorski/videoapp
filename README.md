# Video App

This app allows users to save their favorite videos found on the Internet. The app is currently supporting YouTube and Vimeo videos.

## Usage

This repo is not providing API credentials for YouTube or Vimeo. However, you can test the app by loading a hardcoded list of videos (just click the button).

If you wish to create your own credentials, do so and just update the environment.ts file with your API keys.
